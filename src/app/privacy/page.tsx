              use, and protect personal information when you use the InvestorPilot
              platform.

            <p>
              We use the following sub-processors. Each operates under its own
              privacy and security policies, linked below.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Supabase — database, authentication, file storage</li>

              database is hosted in Supabase&apos;s ap-northeast-2 region in Seoul, South Korea,
              and the sub-processors above also operate overseas, including in the United States.
              We take reasonable steps to ensure overseas recipients handle your information
              consistently with the Australian Privacy Principles, but we cannot control an
              overseas recipient&apos;s handling to the same degree as our own.

            <h3 className="mb-2">Data retention</h3>
            <p>
              Operator-account data is retained for the lifetime of the account.
              Audit log entries are retained indefinitely for compliance traceability.
              Prospect data is retained while it remains relevant to the operator&apos;s
              outreach workflow; operators may delete prospect records at any time.

            <p>
              We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted
              transport (HTTPS), encrypted storage (Supabase), row-level security
              for tenant isolation, and OAuth-based channel authentication (we never
              hold raw social or email credentials).
